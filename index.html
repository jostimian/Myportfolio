            <p>Hello I'am a 11 years old student that have interest in robotics programming and science<br>

        <p>     My journey to the programming world is to long story
            i started programming when i'm 9yrs old and the first
            programming language i learn is <a href="https://www.python.org">python</a>
            becuase i just searched online for how to create a baymax and i just accedentaly
            click a tutorial on how to create a <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/BAYMAX-My-First-Python-Project/">baymax using python </a>   
            and i dont know python in that day i search it in and saw that it is a programming language and 
            i think that programming is to hard so i ask my mom to help me and as i create it 
            it makes me happy becuase it is so easy language to learn and as i continue to learn i started
            to try some new programming language i try html, css js, and java but i stoped learning java
            becuase it is overriding the python syntax in my brain until in this day i can now create simple
            applet using python. So that is the begining of my journey in to the big programming worls    
         </p>
